## Project Overview

AI Wallet Insights represents the future of blockchain analytics - where complex transaction data becomes as easy to understand as having a conversation. Instead of struggling with raw blockchain explorers or writing complex queries, users can simply ask questions in natural language and receive intelligent, contextual answers.

### Why We Built This

The Bitcoin and Stacks ecosystems contain billions of dollars in transactions, but understanding wallet behavior remains a technical challenge. Current blockchain explorers show raw data without context, making it difficult for users to:

- Understand their own transaction patterns
- Analyze wallet behavior and trends  
- Extract meaningful insights from transaction history
- Make informed decisions based on blockchain data

We built AI Wallet Insights to democratize blockchain analytics, making Stacks data accessible to everyone from crypto newcomers to DeFi power users, directly supporting the core mission of Stacks: unlocking the Bitcoin economy.

## Revolutionary Features

**Three-Tier AI Agent System** - Our breakthrough architecture handles any complexity of blockchain analysis through intelligent agent orchestration

**Interactive Visual Analytics** - Revolutionary graph protocol system that automatically generates beautiful, interactive charts from natural language requests

**Conversational Analytics** - Transform complex blockchain queries into natural language conversations

**Real-time Intelligence** - Instant analysis of wallet balances, transaction patterns, and behavioral insights

**Advanced Agent Modes** - Specialized AI agents for different types of analysis, from simple queries to complex data processing

**Background Data Processing** - Intelligent preloading and caching for lightning-fast responses

**Self-Correcting AI** - Advanced error recovery and code generation with recursive improvement

## How It Works

AI Wallet Insights operates through a sophisticated three-tier AI agent system that intelligently routes queries based on complexity and data requirements:

### 1. Regular Mode
For simple, direct questions that can be answered with currently loaded data:
- "What's my current balance?"
- "How many transactions do I have?"
- "What was my last transaction?"

The AI responds instantly using the wallet's basic transaction data (typically the 20 most recent transactions).

### 2. Agent Mode  
For specific queries requiring targeted data fetching:
- "Show me transaction number 500"
- "What happened on a specific date?"
- "Get details about a particular transaction"

Agent Mode uses our intelligent protocol to fetch specific data from the Stacks API and provide precise answers.

### 3. Pro Agent Mode
For complex analysis requiring processing of entire transaction histories:
- "Which address received the most STX from me?"
- "List all unique recipients"
- "Analyze my transaction patterns over time"

Pro Agent Mode processes thousands of transactions with custom JavaScript code execution, providing comprehensive analysis impossible with traditional blockchain explorers.

## The Agent Protocol

At the heart of our system is an innovative JSON-based protocol that enables AI to dynamically control data fetching and processing:

```json
{
  "action": "use_agent",
  "uri": "https://api.testnet.hiro.so/extended/v1/address/ADDRESS/transactions",
  "uri_data": null,
  "recursive": true,
  "code": "JavaScript code for data processing"
}
```

### Protocol Components

**action**: Always "use_agent" to trigger the agent system
**uri**: The full API endpoint URL to fetch data from
**uri_data**: Optional JSON data to send with POST requests
**recursive**: Boolean flag for advanced processing modes
**code**: Custom JavaScript code for Pro Agent Mode analysis

### Agent Mode Variations

**Regular Agent Mode**:
```json
{
  "action": "use_agent",
  "uri": "https://api.testnet.hiro.so/extended/v1/address/ADDRESS/transactions?limit=1&offset=500",
  "uri_data": null
}
```

**Flash Agent Mode** (with regex search):
```json
{
  "action": "use_agent", 
  "uri": "https://api.testnet.hiro.so/extended/v1/address/ADDRESS/transactions",
  "uri_data": null,
  "recursive": true,
  "regex": "/\\bSPECIFIC_ADDRESS\\b/"
}
```

**Pro Agent Mode** (with code execution):
```json
{
  "action": "use_agent",
  "uri": "https://api.testnet.hiro.so/extended/v1/address/ADDRESS/transactions", 
  "uri_data": null,
  "recursive": true,
  "code": "const fs = require('fs'); const data = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('cache.tmp.json', 'utf8')); /* analysis code */"
}
```

## Agent Architecture Deep Dive

### Regular Agent Mode
**Purpose**: Fetch specific data points or transaction ranges
**Power**: Direct API access with precise parameter control
**Problem Solved**: Getting exact transactions or specific blockchain data
**How It Works**: AI generates a JSON request with specific API parameters, system fetches data and returns results

### Flash Agent Mode  
**Purpose**: Search through large transaction datasets for specific patterns
**Power**: Recursive search with regex pattern matching across all transactions
**Problem Solved**: Finding specific addresses, transaction types, or patterns in massive datasets
**How It Works**: AI provides a regex pattern, system searches through all transactions asynchronously until match found, stops immediately when pattern matches

### Pro Agent Mode
**Purpose**: Complex analysis requiring custom data processing logic
**Power**: Full JavaScript code execution on aggregated transaction data
**Problem Solved**: Advanced analytics like "find all unique recipients", "calculate transaction patterns", "analyze spending behavior"
**How It Works**: 
1. System fetches ALL transaction data for the wallet
2. Saves aggregated data to structured JSON file
3. AI generates custom JavaScript code for analysis
4. System executes code and returns processed results
5. Self-correcting mechanism fixes code errors automatically

### Advanced Features

**Background Data Preloading**: When a wallet is loaded, the system automatically begins fetching all transaction data in the background, making Pro Agent Mode responses nearly instantaneous.

**Intelligent Caching**: Complete transaction datasets are cached with metadata, preventing redundant API calls and enabling instant responses.

**Recursive Error Correction**: When AI-generated code fails, the system automatically provides error context back to the AI, which generates corrected code. This process repeats up to 10 times until successful execution.

**Conversation Memory**: Full conversation history is maintained, allowing the AI to reference previous questions and build upon earlier analysis.

**Conflict Prevention**: Smart synchronization prevents multiple agents from fetching the same data simultaneously, avoiding API rate limits.

## Visual Analytics System

### Revolutionary Graph Protocol

AI Wallet Insights introduces the world's first **Graph Protocol** - a JSON-based communication system that enables AI to automatically generate beautiful, interactive visualizations from natural language requests. This breakthrough technology transforms complex blockchain data into stunning charts and graphs with zero manual configuration.

### How Visual Analytics Works

1. **Natural Language Request**: User asks for a chart (e.g., "Show me monthly transaction activity with a graph")
2. **AI Analysis**: AI determines what data is needed and selects the optimal visualization type
3. **Pro Agent Mode Activation**: System fetches comprehensive blockchain data using our agent protocol
4. **Graph Protocol Generation**: AI responds with structured JSON containing complete graph specifications
5. **Interactive Rendering**: Frontend automatically creates beautiful, animated, interactive visualizations
6. **Enhanced Interaction**: Users can hover for detailed tooltips and click to expand to full-screen view

### Graph Protocol Format

The Graph Protocol uses a sophisticated JSON structure that contains everything needed to create professional visualizations:

```json
{
  "graph": "VBC",                           // Graph type identifier
  "x_axis_data": ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar"],     // Category labels or time periods
  "y_axis_data": [150, 200, 180],          // Numeric values for each category
  "title": "Monthly Transaction Activity",   // Main chart title
  "subtitle": "Transactions per month",      // Optional descriptive subtitle
  "value_label": "Transactions",            // Dynamic tooltip label
  "colors": ["#3b82f6", "#8b5cf6"],        // Custom color scheme
  "text": "Peak activity in February...",     // AI-generated insights
  "tooltip_data": {                         // Enhanced interactive information
    "Jan": {
      "value": 150,
      "info": "Winter activity period",
      "additionalMetrics": {
        "success_rate": "98.7%",
        "avg_amount": "1.2M STX",
        "top_recipient": "ST1ABC...DEF"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
